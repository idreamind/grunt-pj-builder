grunt-pj-builder
================

Script to build the tree of directories and files of the project.


To use, run the following command (ONLY ONCE!):

    $ git clone https://github.com/idreamind/grunt-pj-builder.git

    $ cd grunt-pj-builder && grunt
	
or

	$ cd grunt-pj-builder 
	$ grunt name:YourProjectName
	$ grunt name:YourProjectName
	
Yes, two times! We have the problem, but I don`t know how to solve it...
